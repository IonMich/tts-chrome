## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`**: Convert entire page to speech

### Context Menu

### Smart Page Content Detection
The whole page TTS feature intelligently extracts content by:
- Prioritizing main content areas (`article`, `main`, `.content`)
- Including page titles from heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- Filtering out navigation, headers, footers, ads, and sidebar content
- Falling back to document title if no heading is found

- Default voice & gain: `src/lib/ttsClient.ts`
- UI styles: `src/index.css`
